Rosetta input files for membrane protein designs 

This is a repository for the Rosetta files used to design the membrane proteins discussed in my Thesis. This includes the Rosetta scripts (XML files), resfiles, constraints files, amino acid composition files and cofactor/ligand parameters. Files for specific designs can be found within their respective directories.
